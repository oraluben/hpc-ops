## Performance

### Maximum observed speedup per operator

| Operator         | Baseline                           | Prefill      | Decode |
|:----------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------:|:------:|
| Attention (bf16) | FlashInfer, FA2, FA3, TensorRT-LLM | 1.33x        | 2.22x  |
| Attention (fp8)  | FlashInfer, FA3, TensorRT-LLM      | 1.12x        | 2.0x   |
| FusedMoE (fp8)   | TensorRT-LLM, vLLM                 | 1.49x        | 1.14x  |
| GroupGEMM (fp8)  | DeepGEMM                           | 1.1x         | 1.88x  |

*We focus on maximum speedup to highlight the optimization potential, as performance varies substantially across cases.*


## Supporting Kernels

### Attention
- Decode, Prefill: Optimized kernels for all attention phases, including paged attention.

### Grouped GEMM
- Quantized Grouped GEMM: FP8 weights with block-wise or per-tensor scaling

### Fused MoE
- Quantized Fused MoE: FP8 expert weights with block-wise or per-tensor scaling

## Quick Start

### Requirements
- NVIDIA SM90 architecture GPU
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Compilers with C++17 support
- CUDA Toolkit: CUDA 12.8 or higher

*You can set up the environment by installing the modules listed in requirements-dev.txt.*

### Install from Source

#### With host CUDA toolchain
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tencent/hpc-ops.git
cd hpc-ops

# Ensure CUDA toolkit is installed on the host (e.g., /usr/local/cuda)
pip install . -v
```

#### With pip-provided CUDA toolchain (no host CUDA required)

Option A — pip toolchain in the current environment (use `--no-build-isolation`):

```bash
pip install nvidia-cuda-nvcc nvidia-cuda-cccl scikit-build-core cmake ninja
pip install . -v --no-build-isolation
```

Option B — pip toolchain in another virtualenv or path:

```bash
# Point to the cu<ver> directory inside another venv's site-packages
export WITH_PIP_CUDA_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/venv/lib/python3.x/site-packages/nvidia/cu13
pip install . -v
```

#### Build wheel
```bash
make wheel
python3 -m pip install dist/*.whl
```

### Basic Usage
Example: GroupGEMM fp8 kernel usage
```python
import torch
import hpc

num_tokens = 1024
num_group, n, k = 8, 4096, 4096
x = torch.randn((num_tokens, k), dtype=torch.float, device="cuda").to(torch.float8_e4m3fn)
w = torch.randn((num_group, n, k), dtype=torch.float, device="cuda").to(torch.float8_e4m3fn)
scale = torch.full((num_group,), 1.0, dtype=torch.float, device="cuda")
num_tokens_per_group = torch.full((num_group,), 8, dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda")
cu_num_tokens_per_group = torch.cumsum(torch.cat([torch.tensor([0], dtype=torch.int32, device="cuda"), num_tokens_per_group]), dim=0).to(torch.int32)

output = hpc.group_gemm_pertensor_fp8(
    x, w, num_tokens_per_group, cu_num_tokens_per_group, scale,
)
```

## Roadmap

- **Sparse Attention Kernels**: Optimized for long-context LLMs, these kernels boost throughput for memory-bound workloads.
- **Extended Quantization Support**: Flexible strategies (4bit/8bit mixed-precision included)  kernel optimizations for quantized attention and GEMM which balance speed and accuracy.
- **Compute-Communication Boundary-Breaking Kernels**: Overlapped computation and inter-GPU communication logic to  minimizes overhead in multi-node/multi-GPU distributed inference.

We welcome targeted, high-impact contributions—whether it’s fixing edge-case kernel bugs, or submitting optimizations for niche LLM inference scenarios, your PRs will help refine this toolkit for production use.
